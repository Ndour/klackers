## Klackers

_What's the best strategy to play Klackers?_

Klackers (a.k.a. Shut the Box) is a dice game, often played in bars. The Klackers box has nine "tiles" numbered 1-9. A player rolls two dice, then flips down tiles that sum to the value of their roll. The player continues to roll the dice and flip tiles until they are no longer able to find a combination of tiles that sum to the dice or they have flipped all of the tiles. The player's score is the sum of the un-flipped tiles.

This program is a Monte Carlo simulation, which I have written to determine the best simple strategy for Klackers.
